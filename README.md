## Introduction

This is a set of very concise lecture notes written for [CIE A-level Physics](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-physics-9702/) (syllabus code 9702). Presumably the target audience of the notes are students studying the relevant course.

Note that there will be an update for the syllabus since 2022. The sections on electronics and telecommunication are removed from the new syllabus, while some introductory astronomy and cosmology are added in. The rest of the subject contents mostly remain unchanged.

So far, my lecture notes cover the subject contents in current syllabus only. But I have plans to extend these notes for the new syllabus.

## How to Use

Master file: a-level-physics.tex

The master file references the included chapters, each chapter is in separated .tex file as suggested by file names.

My default compiler is PdfLaTeX, which is recommended. XeLaTeX also works fine for me. I am not sure about other compilers.

If you are a student, you might simply want to [download the compiled .pdf file](https://github.com/yuhao-yang-cy/a2physics/blob/master/a-level-physics.pdf) for your own use.
